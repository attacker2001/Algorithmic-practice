The galactic games have begun!

It's the galactic games! Beings of all worlds come together to compete in
several interesting sports, like nroogring, fredling and buzzing (the
beefolks love the last one). However, there's also the traditional marathon
run.

Unfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last years, and the committee
decided to place sensors on the track. Committees being committees, they've
come up with the following rule:

A sensor should be placed every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g. at 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 18mâ€¦.
Since you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors. Even
worse, you don't know how long the track will be! And since there might be
more than a single track, and you can't be bothered to do all of this by
hand, you decide to write a program instead.

Task

Return the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below a number. Being the galactic
games, the tracks can get rather large, so your solution should work for
really large numbers (greater than 1,000,000).

Examples

solution (10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9
solution (20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18
